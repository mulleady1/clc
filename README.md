It can be frustrating that you can't search for jobs on 
craigslist in a larger scope than your current city,
especially when you live on the border of multiple cities, 
or if you're looking for telecommute work. 

That's the motivation for this tool. It checks a base 
city's craigslist homepage for the nearby cities list. 
From there you select cities and enter the job code to 
search for jobs in your cities of interest.
