craigslist crawler
=================

From what I understand, you can't search for jobs on 
craigslist in a larger scope than your current city. 
This is frustrating when you live on the border of 
multiple cities, or when you're looking for telecommute
work. 

That's the motivation for this tool. It checks
a default city's craigslist homepage, gets the nearby
cities list, then aggregates all software jobs into
a list. Each item in the list consists of the job posting's
url, title, and body. 

I'll be adding export options and probably a web interface
next, along with filters.
